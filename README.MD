# Course Project Guidelines

In this course, you will have the opportunity to build two projects, one using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and the other using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js). Below are the guidelines and requirements for each project.

## MERN Stack Project

### Project Description
For the MERN stack project, you will be creating a full-stack web application using MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. The project should demonstrate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and incorporate user authentication.

### Requirements
- **Backend (Node.js and Express.js)**
  - Set up a RESTful API using Express.js.
  - Implement CRUD operations for managing data.
  - Integrate user authentication using Passport.js or any other authentication middleware.
  - Use MongoDB for data storage.

- **Frontend (React)**
  - Create a user interface using React.
  - Implement components for displaying data and handling user interactions.
  - Use React Router for client-side routing.
  - Implement forms for user input and interaction.
  - Utilize state management to handle application state.

- **Deployment**
  - Deploy your application to a hosting service such as Heroku or Netlify.

## MEAN Stack Project

### Project Description
For the MEAN stack project, you will be building a full-stack web application using MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js. Similar to the MERN stack project, this project should demonstrate CRUD operations and include user authentication.

### Requirements
- **Backend (Node.js and Express.js)**
  - Set up a RESTful API using Express.js.
  - Implement CRUD operations for managing data.
  - Integrate user authentication using Passport.js or any other authentication middleware.
  - Use MongoDB for data storage.

- **Frontend (Angular)**
  - Develop a user interface using Angular.
  - Implement components for displaying data and handling user interactions.
  - Use Angular Router for client-side routing.
  - Create forms for user input and interaction.
  - Manage application state using Angular services and RxJS.

- **Deployment**
  - Deploy your application to a hosting service such as Heroku or Netlify.

## Additional Notes
- You are encouraged to choose a project idea that interests you and aligns with your learning goals.
- You can use external libraries, frameworks, and tools as needed, but make sure to justify your choices in your project documentation.
- Document your project thoroughly, including installation instructions, usage guidelines, and any additional information that may be helpful for users and developers.
- Feel free to seek assistance from instructors, classmates, or online resources if you encounter challenges during the project development process.
- Have fun and be creative with your projects! This is your opportunity to showcase your skills and creativity in full-stack web development.
